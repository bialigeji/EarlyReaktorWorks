# EarlyReaktorWorks
Hi, I'm null, or you can call me bialigeji if you can pronounce it. This repository was initially created to stock my old reaktor patches I made more than 1 year ago.
I started up with various synth vsts and after a while I got unsatisfied with the limits of these vst, which is often just tweaking some knobs and pushing the faders
, so I decided to move on and learned how to use Reaktor, but since I don't know how the logic and circuit actually works I could only build in Primary.
Then I also did Pure Data for a while, and later I will make this repository a place to stock all my audio-programming patches, but not just Reaktor.
